**CSS**

I done raw CSS, because with shared class names, this wouldn't end up being too much work. It's not large enough to benefit from any more complex styling setup.

Plus, modern CSS makes things easy. Using Flexbox for a layout, and responsive size units with great built in functions like `min()` & `max()` to eliminate the need for media queries in some situations.

**JavaScript**

I used raw JS with the helper library of Axios to make AJAX requests. I felt like doing this, since the task was small enough, and Axios makes making HTTP requests easier than ever.

The API endpoint wasn't giving out the data that I needed, so I still wrote in the code I would've used, and kept the sample data so you could see the design used.
